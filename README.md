# Response Email

## About Me
I am Alejandro van den Bussche, I have a brand called Rocket Media, with which I offer my services in Graphic Design, Web Design and Web Development. This particular project was designed and developed for our client Restorationb Maintenance, who needed an email to respond to the appointments requested by their clients on the company website.

## Work Structure

We developed this project with HTML and CSS, using the table methodology, ensuring that this email can be viewed perfectly in the most used email clients, such as Gmail, Outlook, Mail, etc. The email is totally responsive, so it looks good adapted in its mobile format.
